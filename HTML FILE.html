            <h2> MY CHILDHOOD BACKGROUND</h2>
        My name is Azumah Francis Jr. Yengariba, but I usually go by the nickname "Zoom Zoom" or "FJ." <br>I was born in Norton Shores, a county in the state of Michigan. I hold dual citizenship:<br> from the United States of America and one from Ghana.
        I was raised by two wonderful parents<br>who shaped me into the independent and remarkable person I am today.<br>My father, Mr. Francis Azumah, and my mother, Mrs. Elizabeth Comfort Azumah, have been my greatest influencers.<br>
        During my Childhood, I spent most of my life in kumasi with my mum. My Dad was far away because<br>of work.
       I am the first born of my parents and I have two other sibilings who go by the name Mitchelle<br>and Jason.
          <br> When i was little, I loved destroying items and i always tried to fix them back. I also decided to learn how to play the piano because<br> i found it very cool and exciting to play an instrument.

            <h3>MY TRANSITION YEAR</h3>
            To further my education, I attended the Hilltop school, a school known for its excellency,<br>knowledge and integrity.
            I had both of my primary and Junior secondary education in the schoool.<br>In Hilltop, I loved playing basketball and i also learnt how to play the piano as well.<br>
            At the end of my nine years, I had to write my final exams which could guarantee a spot in one of the<br> best secondary schools in Ghana. By the Grace of God I was accepted into the prestigious<br>Presbyterian Boys' Secondary school in Accra.

            The opportunity to attend PRESEC  was the best thing that ever happened to me.<br> PRESEC gave me the opportunity to uncover my skills and potential in not only<br>academic ability but also my spirituality as well.
            In PRESEC, I joined a number<br>of clubs such as the rotary club and the robotics clubs. Not only did stick close to<br>my books but also I served in the house of God as the prayer secretary for PENSA in my final year.<br>
            After completeing Presec, I decided to read computer engineering at the remarkable Kwame<br>Nkrumah University of Science and Technology.

            <h5>THE BIG QUESTION: WHY COMPUTER ENGINEERING</h5>
            Computer engineering is more or less a bridge between electrical engineering and computer science.<br>It is a field of science and engineering that deals with building, designing, testing and optimizing of computer related inventions purposely to impact<br> the world around us to bring change and comfortability.
            I chose computer engineering because I was quite fascinated about the principles that govern how computers work.I would love to dive deeep into the field of computer engineering by studing more of artificial intelligence and machine learning coupled with little knowledge in robotics and embedded systems.<br>
            By acquiring knowledge in these fields of study , I could apply them in the building and designing of therapeutics and monitoring systems which could improve the health of patients in the health sector.
